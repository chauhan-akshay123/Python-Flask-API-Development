# Project Setup

This project utilizes a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies and avoid conflicts with globally installed packages.

**1. Setting up the Virtual Environment**

- Create a virtual environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment: Â  

On Windows:

Bash

venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
2. Installing Dependencies

Install Flask within the activated virtual environment:

Bash

pip install Flask
3. Generating Requirements File

Generate a requirements.txt file to track all installed dependencies:

Bash

pip freeze > requirements.txt
This file can be used to easily recreate the same environment on other machines or for future installations.

4. Activating the Virtual Environment (for future sessions)

To activate the virtual environment in subsequent sessions, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the appropriate activation command (as shown above).
5. Deactivating the Virtual Environment

To deactivate the virtual environment, type deactivate in the terminal.
Note:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for each project to ensure proper dependency isolation and avoid conflicts.
